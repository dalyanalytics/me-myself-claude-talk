1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:02,014
Hi everyone,

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:05,449
I'm so excited to be here with you all, presenting my talk,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,211
uhm, titled Me, Myself, and Claude.

4
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:13,036
How I leverage AI-assisted development to scale my R-based data

5
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:16,256
science consultancy. I'm Jasmin.

6
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:18,465
But a little bit more about who I am.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm an R developer and data scientist since about 2014.

8
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:25,828
I'm the maintainer of four R packages,

9
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,803
ShinyLP, ttbBeer,

10
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,575
AviListR, and ShinyFat,

11
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:34,186
and we'll go over the last two, uh,

12
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:36,350
in the upcoming slides as well.

13
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:40,371
I'm the Principal Consultant at Daily Analytics.

14
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,999
Focused on delivering solutions with data science,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,280
analytics, AI. Focused on non-profit and mission-driven orgs.

16
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:52,665
Uhm. Advantage both the technical and the writing aspect of

17
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:56,456
the consultancy, as well as the sales and marketing aspect.

18
00:00:56,457 --> 00:01:00,471
And just to also level set everybody,

19
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:06,303
uhm, I am also the mom of two young kids with really good resources.

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,476
Uhm, I'm an active volunteer in my community.

21
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:14,141
So, uh, leveraging AIS's development in my practice has been a

22
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:18,406
real game changer and I'm so excited to preview some of my thoughts and

23
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:21,989
concepts and how I like- Let's Umm,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,258
aisis development and specifically cloud and cloud code.

25
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:31,516
So I came upon- on this post and this image on LinkedIn and it

26
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:34,897
was a really great description of a lot of thoughts I think that have

27
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:37,269
been flying around in my head. Umm,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
really around moving beyond vibe coding.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,701
Umm, vibe coding is this funny little term that's popped up.

30
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:49,254
Uhm, but it's really important that we understand that having

31
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:52,736
the proper language helps us to orient the conversation.

32
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,663
Around the work that we're actually doing,

33
00:01:55,664 --> 00:02:00,771
besides some of the fun silly stuff or the mistakes that we're highlighting.

34
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:03,135
Web coding often implies reckless,

35
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:06,390
hopeless, hope-based development rattler.

36
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,811
Umm, vibe engineering is intense.

37
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,402
Intentional can be a countable, uhm,

38
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:14,046
AI system development. Umm,

39
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:16,552
and what I like to phrase, uh,

40
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,007
about How I'm doing is using a lot more words and not just using,

41
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,106
uhh, the small little phrases.

42
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,251
I'm using a new, agentic tool,

43
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:26,794
I'm adding a new agentic tool to my toolbox.

44
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:30,089
And it's an honest acknowledgement about exploration phase of,

45
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,227
like, this hyperb- growth mode and learning,

46
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:37,020
uhm, and it really helps reframe and understand and not devalue the

47
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:40,171
work that I do and the work that I've done. Before AI,

48
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,368
um, has come into place. Um,

49
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:45,022
and so I really like, um, for us to,

50
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:47,731
as we're going forward and think as- you're just seeing the rest of the

51
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:51,868
sides, like, this is all, umm,

52
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,003
a new tool in our toolbox, a new way of thinking.

53
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:58,251
Umm, it's not reckless, it's not hope-based.

54
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:03,033
There's a lot of deep intention in what I'm building.

55
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:06,498
For my clients. So,

56
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,854
part one, strategic thinking unlocked for greater community contributions.

57
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:12,957
questions. So,

58
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,045
the mental bandwidth shift of where I was at,

59
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:20,808
probably around this time last year before I was- using AI and my

60
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,506
code development and my practice. Umm,

61
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:26,214
as the principal consultant and developer,

62
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,712
I spent in- enormous amount of time writing code.

63
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:32,044
Umm, totally what I signed up for,

64
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,436
brings me a lot of joy. Umm,

65
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:39,045
but really- We doesn't allow me to spend the really meaningful time

66
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,687
doing business development, networking,

67
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,328
uhh, the community. The aspect and the real,

68
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,812
sometimes the real joyful aspects of this work.

69
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:51,273
And what I found, looking back from- All right.

70
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,015
So, thank Thank you. All right. Last year to now, with AI, integrated into

71
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:59,051
my development process, I get to steal a little bit of that time back.

72
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:03,306
back. And partition it across more emphasis on business development

73
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:06,372
and business operations, which is really important for scaling and growth.

74
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:11,053
Um And as well as getting back into the community and our stats

75
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:15,131
community, which really brings me a lot of joy and really helps connect up

76
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,173
the wall. Why? Of what I do, uhm,

77
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,247
and giving back. And so, it's been a really interesting shift about,

78
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:24,275
uhm, having the same amount of time and- limited at that,

79
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:27,218
um, and where it goes towards and what I can now do,

80
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:30,273
now that I leverage, AI-assisted code development.

81
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:33,088
So,

82
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:37,145
what that really buys you, to kind of flesh it out,

83
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,694
uh, better be- is ops. Uhm,

84
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:42,480
I get to spend a lot of time improving my systems,

85
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,132
automating things, standardizing things,

86
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,182
uhh, coming f- from being a,

87
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:50,549
um, a developer to now being a business owner.

88
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,388
Uhm, efficiency is key where I spend my time.

89
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,928
It is really important, um, and it's important to have systems that match up,

90
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:58,498
uhm, the way I think and the way I want to operate this business.

91
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:03,359
And it really, it's a sustainable,

92
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,978
thoughtful way that doesn't also lead to burnout.

93
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,871
Uh, having a lot of understand,

94
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,273
time to understand, cash flow. Pricing strategy,

95
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,539
profitability, packaging, uhm,

96
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:16,951
the services up that I do, it really opened up a lot more time

97
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:19,147
to think about. Uh,

98
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,173
these aspects, uh,

99
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:25,188
relationship building, uh, I've been able to go to so many more in-person events,

100
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:30,056
virtual events, like this one. On creating content and posts and community engagement,

101
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:33,383
um, and it's been so wonderful to get back out there,

102
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:36,827
um, and meet more people. And hear about what they're doing and the ways

103
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:40,350
in which they're solving their problems. So,

104
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:44,232
the creative space, uh, really the w- room to think about what could be

105
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,753
built and not just what must be built.

106
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:49,100
It's a really fun time I'm finding,

107
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:52,699
uhm, to be- We'll you in the not just super heads down in what

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,725
I'm doing, uhm, but really think about,

109
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:56,799
well, if I had more time, if I had,

110
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,669
uh, you know, a couple more hours,

111
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:03,138
what could I build? Umm, that could be interesting,

112
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:06,006
that could be fun, that could be silly, that could change,

113
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,906
have somebody else- umm, goes about their work,

114
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:11,803
umm, and so that's been really exciting to have that creative space back.

115
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,136
So, uh, going to- you o-go overview,

116
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:18,684
uhh, a package that I wrote, uhh,

117
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,329
called Shanei Fa, uhh, and I was released,

118
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,685
uhh, a little earlier. 3 3 4 last, uhh,

119
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:26,842
the shear. Umm, and so really starting at the client problem.

120
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,996
Umm, so I had a client,

121
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:33,005
and it took me a very, very long time to onboard,

122
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,202
umm, to their application. Umm,

123
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:37,590
grateful for their patience and their guidance. Umm,

124
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:40,036
but it was massive. ... Stream massive, shiny-up.

125
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:44,777
Lots of different files, interconnected functions uh,

126
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,883
the structure of it.

127
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:51,174
Challenging it almost. Sometimes not fun to work on it.

128
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:55,701
Sometimes you get a, you know, a shot to your confidence when you're kind

129
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:59,226
of fighting file systems and folders and,

130
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,390
uh, just not where you want to be.

131
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:04,079
Um, and so I thought Hey, like,

132
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,271
I'm writing shiny and great, but also I can leverage some of my other

133
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:11,915
skills in R. Why don't I apply that to the overall on boarding and

134
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,115
getting to understand what I'm looking at.

135
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:17,433
And so that worked into a quick little script,

136
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:20,637
kind of, what-off functions Umm,

137
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,673
where the output, right, on the right-hand side is the file name,

138
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:29,338
and the type, and the name, and having just this level of information

139
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,121
in this format, umm,

140
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,435
was game changer, umm,

141
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:37,627
really helped. Thank you. To connect up what I was doing,

142
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:42,086
what changes I was making, how I needed to understand different parts of the

143
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,629
code. Umm, and so then that led to the thought process of the

144
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,670
outs that I've had before, if it's helping me now,

145
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:53,400
could it help somebody else? And so I turned it into a package,

146
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:56,977
which is published on CRAN, um, and I really hope all y'all can test

147
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,243
drive it and let me know if it also helps.

148
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:04,095
And prove your development aspect when it comes to navigating large training applications.

149
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,156
And so, yes, before AI, It's a nice,

150
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,363
some day project, but with AI,

151
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,699
I built this and released it in weeks.

152
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:16,139
weeks. The next package,

153
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,517
uh, that I developed recently this year,

154
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:20,735
um, it's called Avi Listar, uh,

155
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,006
and not super technical lifts,

156
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,458
uh. Uh, being really forthcoming about that.

157
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,799
Um, I have this new hobby this year,

158
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,795
birding. Uh, it's fun, it's relaxing,

159
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:34,601
being in nature. If you're enjoying and being around birds.

160
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:39,134
And so, I found this newly released taxonomy.

161
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:42,615
me. Uh, sheet in Excel. Uhm,

162
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:45,820
and it's great, right? Excel, we can all work with Excel for the most

163
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:49,322
part. Uhm, but I want to- to have this opportunity to think,

164
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:52,079
well, can I make an R package?

165
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,518
That's silly. Like, an R package with burn it.

166
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,933
Umm, that is not a,

167
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:01,276
you know, a large technical lift, but maybe it could be more accessible for

168
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:03,558
folks. Umm, and so it's a really large,

169
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,904
Excel sheet, um, wrapped it up,

170
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:10,147
um, and has always really interesting aspects,

171
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:14,167
uh, about this, I built this in a weekend,

172
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:17,601
uh, for me personally,

173
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,638
uh, I,

174
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:22,485
I was never moving at this speed,

175
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:24,986
uhm, for a contact setting.

176
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,246
The two previous packages I published,

177
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,494
Shane, A. L. P. and T. T. B. Beer,

178
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:32,430
were published in 2016.

179
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,718
Avi Lister, uh, which was published in June on Cray,

180
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:41,128
This year, that is eight years and nine months between

181
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,763
my first set of our packages. Could you hear this?

182
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,922
And this new set. Umm,

183
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,894
I feel this sense of hyper-productivity,

184
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,798
excitements, umm, and just- Just have a good day.

185
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,628
Having the aspect of integrating AI in this development

186
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,608
for packages and community-based tools to be- really transformative,

187
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:04,204
um, and I know there's a lot of aspects of things that were going

188
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,883
on within the last eight years and nine months but I really want to-

189
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:10,469
to underscore what I've been able to do,

190
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,495
um, just this year,

191
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,710
um, in giving back to the community and thinking grander.

192
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:20,082
you're up. about, um, how do I contribute open source code?

193
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,810
And so, yes. Right.

194
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,397
It's not even a. Very crucial package,

195
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:27,652
in my opinion. But it is nice to have.

196
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:31,998
It is fun. Um, and it has now really lovely,

197
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:36,721
And a lot of really great examples about

198
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:39,142
how you integrate this data with some of the existing,

199
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:41,850
uhh, packages. Like, re-bird, umm,

200
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:45,383
and so this is my little, umm, my little passion project and my gift

201
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,083
to the art community. community.

202
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:51,264
So, uh, really holding on,

203
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:54,785
like, AI system development is the creative multiplier,

204
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:58,682
umm. 3 4 and it doesn't save me time on what I was already

205
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:03,385
doing. It, it doesn't away. But it really unlocks what

206
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,885
I wasn't able to do. Uh,

207
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:08,753
what I wasn't able to complete, what I wasn't able to prioritize,

208
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:11,259
uh, simply because when you are having,

209
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,691
uh, Bye. I'm running a solo consultancy,

210
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:17,785
um, and being really strategic about your time and protecting your mental health.

211
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:21,986
Um, very often, sometimes you don't get to do- the really fun things.

212
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:25,585
Um, and so now that I've been able to leverage it in my work

213
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:29,821
processes, able to automate all those- biz dev and biz op systems,

214
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:34,329
it was right much better unit tests and documentation and package branding and hex

215
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,536
stickers. Shout out to Chet t makes- I find it really wonderful,

216
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:42,353
uhm, to collaborate on making those really engaging hex stickers.

217
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:44,358
Umm, and then just having more time.

218
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:47,279
And then for community engagement and knowledge sharing and networking.

219
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,790
Uh, that for me is a really important aspect of the work

220
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,511
I do. And how I show up. And I'm so glad to have been,

221
00:11:55,512 --> 00:12:00,112
um, leveraging AISIS development and cloud code in my process.

222
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:04,164
process. Because I feel like it's not just me,

223
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,755
which is great right now. It is everybody.

224
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:10,314
It is all of our learning path. It is all of our creative endeavor

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,502
and to be able to, one, provide this for my clients,

226
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:16,528
then also provide it for our community, which I love so much.

227
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,253
Umm, has felt really, really meaningful.

228
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:24,563
Alright, saying yes to bigger and funnier problems.

229
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:27,351
So, uh,

230
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,783
this is a aspect of,

231
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:32,187
um, how I think about work.

232
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:36,324
work. Um, whether I am working for myself,

233
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:38,729
for me, my consultancy, or I am,

234
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,429
um, you know, doing- other types of volunteer work,

235
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,014
um, or other types of work in the community.

236
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:49,371
And so, it really sits around the client work- uh,

237
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:51,482
working with values-aligned clients,

238
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:54,873
um, while working with non-profits and misin-driven organizations.

239
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:59,761
Um, these are- that are doing really important boots-on-the-ground,

240
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:02,554
highly interpersonal work in this world.

241
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,293
And I love being able to be in service- to them.

242
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,554
I also really love, um,

243
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:11,230
opportunities to grow technically, um,

244
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:14,459
work on problems that I may not- have the full answer for,

245
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,892
but I have an excitement around it. Umm,

246
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:20,395
exploring new approaches. Umm, and this work keeps things interesting.

247
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,448
Nexting. Umm, and,

248
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,634
uh, mentally engaging. Umm,

249
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:26,926
another aspect is community,

250
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:30,957
uh, professional development. I love- going to networking events,

251
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,156
umm, I love going to conferences,

252
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:36,267
umm, and it's really important for me.

253
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:40,607
Um in that aspect. And as well as intentional rest,

254
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:44,963
umm, all of this does not work unless that- That's it.

255
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:49,479
I have a really good sense of when is work

256
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:52,118
and when is family and friends.

257
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:56,580
friends. time because all of this is in service for that true goal.

258
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,875
And for me, when all of those things hit,

259
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,834
uh, that is. I'm not going for me professional joy.

260
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,921
And that is what I optimize for in my consulting practice.

261
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:09,088
Um, and it really drives me.

262
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,339
. Umm, in the decisions I make, and the folks that I interact with.

263
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:18,786
So, my old filter before ASIS development was coming to a potential

264
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:22,177
new project or a prospect or a client, can I build this in a

265
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:25,163
reasonable time frame with my current skill sets?

266
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,459
Giving my existing client workload.

267
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:30,946
That's- that's what I told myself. Now,

268
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,488
with leveraging cloud and cloud code- and agentic development,

269
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:38,900
my first thought is, I can certainly build it.

270
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:41,243
But, how can I thoughtfully- Please.

271
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:44,707
I spend time deeply understanding the desired outcome,

272
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,435
the client restraints, and the overall delivery.

273
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:50,560
Uhm. So,

274
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,924
I just clawed really as my coding partner,

275
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,323
and sort of the mental model around it, is.

276
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,887
With that, I'm the manager. I set direction.

277
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:02,532
I make the architectural decisions. Uh,

278
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,352
clawed is my senior. Sometimes my junior developer,

279
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,757
Depending on the context that you give it, um,

280
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:11,382
a partner in that endeavor. Implementing solutions,

281
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:13,398
handling boilerplate code, uh,

282
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,658
starting out any of the,

283
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,198
um, scaffolding for packages or shiny applications.

284
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,227
Um, and. Alright.

285
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:25,612
Alright, now, couple of really seeing cloud code as my coding partner means that

286
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:29,472
I am both, like, the human in the process and on- on.

287
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:32,512
So, in and on the loop,

288
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,837
active technical leadership stays with me.

289
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:39,597
I'm both integrated at various different- intersections in the entire process.

290
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,199
And that is a,

291
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,725
uh, table stakes for me. And so- So ways in which I

292
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,279
help manage this partnership, uh,

293
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,598
must be really specific with requirements and roles for Claude.

294
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,199
Uhm, I always review the generated code.

295
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,855
Uh, Claude has this wonderful way of you can,

296
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,435
you can, when you set up your context files,

297
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,674
you can. Have it just, uh,

298
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:08,286
writing code and committing to your GitHub repository and not being a part

299
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:10,755
of that discussion. And that conversation,

300
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:13,196
that work pattern form, um,

301
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,718
for me, I always need to be in the next for that reviewing code.

302
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:21,642
Um, and to say that, I always use really incremental commits.

303
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:24,009
Um, I love how Claude can,

304
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,203
uh, write really detailed- Inhale. Commit messages.

305
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:30,428
I love being able to possibly unwind things back and forth,

306
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,880
and so that's super important for me. And feeding it- documentation links have been

307
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,178
really helpful to help, uh,

308
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:40,957
keep Claude focused and giving it accurate information.

309
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,970
and you next time. I'm also asking for multiple options.

310
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:47,095
I find really using Claude, in addition to coding,

311
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:49,302
as a brainstorming partner, uh,

312
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:51,616
to get me started. On a lot of,

313
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:54,569
uh, the work that I do. And then,

314
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,416
I love to run Claude, sometimes, depending on the project.

315
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:57,918
I can,

316
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:09,061
Amplify my impact to take on bigger and more interesting problems.

317
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:12,260
So, a client example that I really love,

318
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:17,090
um, is I- needed to set up a data orchestration repo,

319
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:21,632
uhm, with a lot of understanding about the client's requirements.

320
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,744
They're technical. I call skill capabilities.

321
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:27,063
Um. GitHub actions made a lot of sense,

322
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:30,078
and so working in API.

323
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,967
Nice and webhooks, and mixing in real way,

324
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,654
uh, for a VM, um,

325
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,899
learning more about how to structure this Yeah,

326
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,372
I'm. Um, but learning,

327
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,831
learning from clog, right? Uh,

328
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:45,630
loading the data in the seaweed base, having a real hand on the wheel,

329
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,005
I would say. In terms of the road level,

330
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:54,208
um, and client isolation aspect for the data security and governance aspect.

331
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:58,786
Umm, and then having all of those client dashboards be written in quarto,

332
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,243
and this client really needed to be able to scale a repeatable,

333
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,562
ehm, ETL process,

334
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,865
uh, secure data layers,

335
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,966
um, in a database,

336
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:13,903
um, for persistency. See? And having the dashboards have the ability,

337
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:16,324
um, to scale and pull each throw data.

338
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:21,533
Uh, well, also having a sh- shared components and template system where

339
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:25,403
client could feature toggle on and off different aspects of the dashboard.

340
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,429
forward. And so this is a really interesting system I was able to develop,

341
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,329
uh, primarily with Claude Code,

342
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,398
um, a lot of back and forth.

343
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:39,057
Uh, it's a lot of understanding about what the requirements were for this project.

344
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:41,819
Um, and a lot of learning on my part,

345
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,018
um, about- how to write better GitHub actions and how to,

346
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:50,120
um, have, uh, GitHub actions do PRs in other repositories.

347
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,237
stories. And have a whole lot of process going,

348
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:56,268
uhh, so this is a really, really fun example,

349
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,523
a and really about.

350
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:01,738
Building right-sized enterprise-grade infrastructure,

351
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,993
um, in just a few weeks with CloudKit's help.

352
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,558
And this would not have been possible before.

353
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,313
So, my usual client project workflow is understanding the requirements,

354
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,229
defining the problem, the technical approach. generating some of the implementation,

355
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,506
cloud writes the initial code, uh,

356
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:21,481
review and course correcting, uh, reviewing every line,

357
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:24,925
checking for issues. Umm, and iterating based on that feedback,

358
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:27,666
fixing problems, refining the solution, uh,

359
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:30,342
and that also then the final QA.

360
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,146
I'm sorry. I deliver a testing thoroughly and then shipping to the client.

361
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:35,546
Um, it's used human decisions at the start,

362
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:39,022
the middle and end, and AI executions sprinkled in the- middle.

363
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:43,511
So I am ruthlessly solutions focused at this moment,

364
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,665
thanks to Cloudcode. Um,

365
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:49,045
it's made me- be even more a better partner,

366
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:51,187
umm, for my clients, I believe.

367
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,734
I'm not thinking about STACs, I get to think about their outcomes.

368
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,789
I'm not thinking about debugging YAML for GitHub Actions.

369
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,572
I get to solve business problems alongside,

370
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,774
um, the stakeholders.

371
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,690
My mental energy goes to what matters,

372
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:09,140
uh, and understanding client needs and delivering that value.

373
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,168
Thank Thank you. I love still matter.

374
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,322
I'm still very entrenched in writing code nearly every day.

375
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:19,648
Uh, but they don't consume my cognitive l- load anymore.

376
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,109
Um, I am not just a person on the computer.

377
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,400
I get to communicate and talk and have these really important And uh,

378
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:29,548
interpersonal relationships with my clients.

379
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:34,865
So, uh, building up your intuition in R.

380
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:39,498
Or, Or, through volume. So I like to think of all of the

381
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,540
learning that I've been doing, umm,

382
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,555
as, ah, high ways, right?

383
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:47,530
Traditional learning, umm, a smaller focused highway,

384
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,534
a few hours, you get to see a few different I appreciate it as

385
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,619
you ring the deck. Recommendation, you're learning,

386
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,655
you're checking stack overflow. Umm,

387
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,846
it can be really, kind of, slow.

388
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:01,704
Meaningfully slow, sometimes, but, I like to think of AI-assisted

389
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:06,144
learning when it comes to involving it in agentic development,

390
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:11,167
is, seeing many approaches in very

391
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:15,038
short amount of time. Umm, and being really mindful of a lot more- More.

392
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,968
Through put, uh, through that highway system,

393
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,993
you have to be mindful some things are gonna go awry,

394
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:23,169
and you need to be able to distill.

395
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:28,096
Uh, what is the core aspect of what you're directly needing,

396
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,803
and, uh, what is just wrong,

397
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:33,923
loosening. And so,

398
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:38,444
I'm gonna go

399
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:40,464
over. Umm,

400
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:43,210
one package mistake. a couple,

401
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,513
a couple of mistakes that happen even in the development.

402
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,184
I'll be right back of this talk, which I used, um,

403
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:50,797
Cloud Code to help me build out all of these slides.

404
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,756
Um, Cloud just doesn't read the docs sometime.

405
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:56,400
and I'm like, just like you as a human,

406
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:59,711
like if you're rushing and you're not reading, you're going to make mistakes because

407
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:01,886
you haven't read about how to do it right.

408
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,714
Um, and so I had Claude,

409
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,611
do a little bit of structure around the- any first slides.

410
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:14,388
And it just pretended that this package meant something around using font-awesome

411
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,590
icons, right? Thank you. Or see, like,

412
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:19,233
how it potentially got there, like, the F.A.

413
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:21,757
from, um, font-awesome,

414
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,988
like, sure. Um, and- then the real error,

415
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:27,355
like, it didn't even install the package,

416
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,535
and, like, a guest, uhm,

417
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:31,753
about the vignettes and examples, and you would think,

418
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:34,526
uh, having access to, uhm,

419
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,744
the package, locally, because I built it,

420
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:39,783
on my machine, would help give it some different context.

421
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:41,798
But it enabled the,

422
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,400
uhm, the LLM to, uh,

423
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,417
learn, but it really hadn't.

424
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:52,109
Um, so even- sometimes packages really establish packages with way more examples out

425
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,626
there, uhm, for, uh,

426
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:57,116
LLM to pull from. you uh, g-plot too.

427
00:22:57,117 --> 00:23:00,043
Sometimes it just confuses a lot of functions as well.

428
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,362
Um, and why this happens,

429
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:05,785
right? You can be experienced. is and busy and assume some things come easy

430
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:08,147
and so you circumvent the system of learning.

431
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:11,847
Um, and so sometimes this forces you to actually Actually,

432
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,717
we, the document to actually feed claw the documentation URL so it can help

433
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,797
self correct for that. Um,

434
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,983
and I think this make sure you better at evaluating.

435
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:23,338
And knowing where good docs live.

436
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:28,897
So, uh, mistake number two, uh, that happened right when I- I was building

437
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:32,299
the slides for this talk. Um, data structure assumptions.

438
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,220
Um, Claude likes to assume and fur,

439
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:38,814
um, from- column names and some state of types if they're not at all,

440
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:41,863
um, matched up or cleaned well and the relationship.

441
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:44,103
Um, but sometimes that is just wrong.

442
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:48,976
Umm, I was building the slide for Obulistar and

443
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,279
it wanted to say that, uh,

444
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,774
for that. to drag the bar chart, uh,

445
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:56,227
the data set was called AviList Global, um,

446
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:59,522
which doesn't exist. It's AviList 2025.

447
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,633
Um, and. It assumed also,

448
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:06,271
uh, some examples from the column names that were lower case or snake

449
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:11,027
case when actually the column. one. More so matches the,

450
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:13,213
umm, the original Excel file.

451
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,971
And so, umm. Mm. This kind of example where it infers

452
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:23,599
the connection instead of, like, asking for maybe a look-up table or having access

453
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,753
to actual art. Umm,

454
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:30,815
and this happens because, like, experience oftentimes breeds assumption and use verification,

455
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:34,785
and you just assume, like, wha all, this is sometimes common place,

456
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:37,121
right, to your snake place versus, title case.

457
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,609
And so lesson is, like, Thank you very much. Often, like,

458
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,704
please, like, very, please leverage,

459
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:46,295
like, MCP tools, um, to give quad actual access to our session

460
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:49,275
in the context. Um, if those packages are loaded,

461
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:53,071
if those, uh, those objects are stored there,

462
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:55,092
um, and,

463
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:59,531
Let uh, NCP tools like integrate and breed the environment that you're in.

464
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,239
And this mistake, I think, from a human aspect,

465
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,067
teaches you, about proper data inspection habits.

466
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:07,696
Um, skills which you should be using constantly,

467
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:10,671
I think, in our world as data practitioners.

468
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:15,475
Cheers. Umm, but often, like, Claude is making these very similar mistakes.

469
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:17,799
Umm, and it's really interesting to see it shown.

470
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,582
Uhh, mistake- 3 over abstraction.

471
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,301
This is probably my biggest gripe with Claude.

472
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:26,698
Umm, it always reaches for the complex solution first.

473
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:30,554
It's always- Always. It's trying to be overly clever. And this example that was-

474
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:34,756
I had when building this slide deck is it tried to do this really-

475
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,822
Really. Integrate, integrate,

476
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:39,861
uh, intricate, uh, sinky diagram,

477
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:42,612
um, and it just started making up functions.

478
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:45,929
Um, It just, it created some nested functions,

479
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,149
when like, a simple, like, dplyard chain would work.

480
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,367
Um, and- We're up.

481
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:55,973
Often, you- I think it's sometimes the examples that it's pulling from

482
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:58,447
to make its decision about, um,

483
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,852
what it's providing you- . . . . and in like, sometimes people are

484
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:03,965
trying to show their expertise. They're trying to build the proper systems.

485
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:06,839
They're trying to, sometimes, that leads to over-engineering.

486
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,027
Um. And when really you're kind of missing out on the focus of like,

487
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,096
um, simple is often better.

488
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:16,009
Um, and then I like to ask Claude a very deep personal,

489
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,275
uhm, interaction with me like, why?

490
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:22,775
Doing it this way, uhm, very often because I've spent so much time without

491
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:25,020
AI. I do know the solution,

492
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:28,224
I do know the path forward, I do know the exact packages that I

493
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:30,441
want not called to use and leverage,

494
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,497
and I asked it why it's doing it, and I feed it,

495
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:35,683
um, some different options, um,

496
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,498
and I try and select the way that is simplest,

497
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:43,429
the way that I would actually And so recognizing

498
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,364
on my sorry complexity has been really helpful to guiding.

499
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:50,579
I did. In the partnership with cloud code in my,

500
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,287
uh, telemetry. And so,

501
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:55,324
um, right. Here's some tips for.

502
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,595
your skills. Building better prompts from these mistakes,

503
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:00,538
uh, feed documentation links upfront,

504
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,732
uh, data assumptions, use MCP tools.

505
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,849
Give them, look at, look up tables,

506
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,685
um, if columns are coded in other ways,

507
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,855
um, over extraction,

508
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:15,051
ask for- We're going to multiple approaches, request sometimes the simplest solution to start.

509
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,205
Uh, learning at scale, like,

510
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:20,105
you're going to encounter these patterns so much more- or,

511
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:23,453
uhm, rather than the traditional learning.

512
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:27,852
Um, and each failure, I think, helps refine your prompting skills and your R-intuitive-

513
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:30,321
so that you don't make those mistakes,

514
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:33,151
and so you can help clone, make those mistakes less.

515
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:38,462
And I think it makes you not- on. I think you become a better

516
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:42,154
technical leader, and you know how to redirect when things go wrong,

517
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:46,918
and leverage what you're- learning from Claude to bring to the real world as

518
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,429
you're interacting with folks, uhm,

519
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,481
to create better software.

520
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:55,006
for. So, I really like to think of this all as,

521
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,298
like, the, the skill development,

522
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,636
um, and so the art of the practice is See ya.

523
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:06,788
It's not necessarily about the final product alone. It's the process.

524
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,006
Awesome. It's just about getting there,

525
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:11,363
uh, understanding patterns,

526
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:14,445
learning from mistakes, building that intuition up.

527
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:19,184
Umm, high-value iteration and failing fast

528
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:23,838
in course correcting, and deliberate practice and pattern recognition.

529
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,813
mission. And the personal satisfaction and growth

530
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:31,814
from overcoming those challenges.

531
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:35,607
Jeez. And maintaining motivation and staying disciplined.

532
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:41,187
I really think ASIS development accelerates this practice by increasing But the

533
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:43,568
discipline of learning is still your own.

534
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:48,188
So, in conclusion, um. Yum.

535
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:51,557
I really want everybody to really hopefully take away,

536
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,137
um, this thought pattern of learning for your

537
00:28:56,138 --> 00:29:00,671
s- self, and then also writing down your values when it comes to

538
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:03,561
interacting with AI, uhm, in your work,

539
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:06,048
in your- for fun, uhm,

540
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,613
and before your next AS is to project,

541
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,969
like, please go through this exercise, write it down.

542
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,732
What will I all- What I do myself.

543
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:17,038
What AI can help me with.

544
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,348
What I need to understand deeply.

545
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,417
And what I'm comfortable delegating.

546
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:27,353
So, some final thoughts. Uhm,

547
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,720
I believe. Uh. Ha! When AI frees up your mental bandwidth,

548
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,852
you don't get lazy. You get strategic.

549
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:38,407
Always building with intention. Thank you. Staying curious about those failures.

550
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:41,329
Staying strategic about solutions.

551
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:45,891
And staying joyful in the work because if we're- not all having fun doing

552
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:48,456
this, I don't think any of this is worth it.

553
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:50,755
So please always remember, have fun,

554
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:54,071
have joy. Umm. Take that intentional rest,

555
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:57,381
be really mindful about what you're building, who you're building it for,

556
00:29:57,382 --> 00:29:59,791
uhm, and ensure that you're not causing any more harm,

557
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:02,488
uh. Through your actions and,

558
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:06,972
uh, your software that you're making. Thank you so much.

559
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:12,288
I've had such a- I'm happy to take questions

560
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:16,638
after. You can reach me if I'm in most places at- at Jeff.

561
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,139
Uh, Stu Moss, you can, uh, visit my website,

562
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,170
dailynalix.com. Um,

563
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,244
and yes, thank you so much. Bye.

564
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:23,244
Bye.
